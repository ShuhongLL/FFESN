# Exploiting Chaotic Dynamics as Deep Neural Network

We propose a framework for directly utilizing chaotic dyanmics as computation medium. The source code contains two distinct dyanmical system: (1) the discrete-time Feedforward ESN (FFESN) and the continous-time Lorenz96 systems.

## System requirements
Our framework rquires only a standard computer with enough RAM, and ideally with GPUs to speed up the training and evaluation of the dynamical systems.

## OS requirements
The framework has been tested on the following systems:
- macOS Ventura 13.6.3
- Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS

## Dependencies
The framework requires `python` version 3.7+

## Installation
Run the following command to install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Please follow the README file under each modules to run and analysis the results
